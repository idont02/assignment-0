This essay is about me talking nonsense. It is a nonsensical argument about creation and destruction.
I will not include topics that make sense, I will talk nonsense.
Firstly, what is creation? Erosion? I never created tennessine before.
No, not evolution. Creation. I have never tried creating a house before!
Maybe a sandcastle, but a sandcastle can be a place to live in, crabs, carbs. Yes, no, hi, carbs.
Destruction is destruction and not destructing. There is a obvious non-obvious difference.

You can see but you can unsee. You can do destruction but, or, you can be destruction.
Felt the feeling. As a destructor, I support antidisestablishmentarianism for no particular reason.
The reason is nonexistent. Zero is not one but not empty. Zero is zero. My goal is empty.
Like the empty set, the o with slash. Slash is not a backlash, or is it?
No, this is a quintessential example of destruction. Please create, or not.
Please do not rejuvenate the land. Or if you want to, please go to the fireplace.

If you detect undetectable sense, report to the sense person. The sense person will help.
Who is the sense person? It is a person who uses his senses to sense senseable sense with sense or no sense.
Ok destroy, create, bye bye I guess. To make this line longer, I added this. Thank you, no thanks, for a hi.
Oh yeah, worksheet, maybe, please, or not, hi, yes, truth, dare, lie, boo, pee, find sense.
